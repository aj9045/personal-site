        Hey all! My name is AJ Stuhrenberg. I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp, an 18 week web development intensive learning experience, in December of 2014, where I learned a good amount of Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. And most recently, I worked at Texts.com, a small startup in NYC. I developed the first versions of their iOS and Android apps using React Native. And I am always looking to learn more! Right now, Iâ€™m brushing up on JavaScript, ReactJS, and learning Redux. Please feel free to contact me with questions, comments, or anything else.
